# Python lessons - CODATA-RDA 2019 - Exercises 
## Exercise 1

* Implement a cube function(`my_cubeFunction`) that takes an integer as an argument and generates an array from 1 to the-lenght-of-interger(X) and finds the cube of each element(Y).

* The function should be part of a module.

* Make a plot of X vrs Y and save to file.


## Exercise 2

- Implement the `insertion sort` algorithm in a function named `insertion_sort` which takes a list `l` as argument and sorts it `in place`.

```
for i = 1 --> length(l)
	j = i
	while j > 0 and l[j] < l[j-1]
		swap l[j] and l[j-1]
		j = j - 1
```

Test it sorting the `sort_this.txt` file.
